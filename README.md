## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gina!

I'm a CS student @ Berkeley who loves creating & being a part of cool things.
Previously, I've led [Notes for Support](https://www.notesforsupport.org/), where we sent 12,600+ letters to COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers across 170+ hospitals in 40 states.
Currently, I'm working as a MLH hackathon judge.
