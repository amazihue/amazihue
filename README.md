## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gina!

I'm an incoming college freshman who loves creating & being a part of cool things. Currently, I'm running [Notes for Support](https://www.notesforsupport.org/), where we've sent 12,500+ letters to COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers across 170+ hospitals in 40 states! I'm also working as a MLH hackathon judge.
