### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Gina.

I'm an incoming college freshman who loves creating & being a part of cool things!

I'm currently working on ðŸ’Œ [Notes for Support](https://www.notesforsupport.org/), an org I launched when the pandemic first hit. So far, we've sent ~12,500 letters to COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers across 170+ hospitals in 40 states!
